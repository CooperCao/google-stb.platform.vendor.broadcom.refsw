PerlExtLib

Description: This library provides an API that regscope can use for accessing
registers and memory.

PerlExtLib is written in C; hence, it cannot be directly accessed by a perl
script, eg., regscope. To address this, a wrapper API, PerlExtLib_wrap.c,
is used in conjunction with a perl package, PerlExtLib.pm.
The wrapper code and perl package are both generated by
SWIG 3.0.10 with PerlExtLib.i as the SWIG interface definition file.
The wrapper code, PerlExtLib.c and related files are then built to create
a run-time library, PerlExtLib.so, This run-time library is used when running
regscope.pl.

The above also applies for Windows but the files are named as follows.
The SWIG interface definition file is PerlExtLib_Win32.i. The generated
wrapper code is PerlExtLib_Win32_wrap.c. The perl package is PerlExtLib.pm.
The run-time library is named PerlExtLib.dll and is generated via MS Visual
Studio.
