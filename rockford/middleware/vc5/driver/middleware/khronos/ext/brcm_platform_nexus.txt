Version

    Version 1 - September 17th, 2015

Number

    EGL Extension #???

Extension Type

    EGL client extension

Dependencies

    Requires EGL_EXT_client_extensions to query its existence without
    a display.

    Requires EGL_EXT_platform_base.

    This extension is written against the wording of version 7 of the
    EGL_EXT_platform_base specification.

Overview

    This extension defines how to create EGL resources from native Nexus
    resources using the functions defined by EGL_EXT_platform_base.

New Types

    None

New Procedures and Functions

    None

New Tokens

    Accepted as the <platform> argument of eglGetPlatformDisplayEXT:

        EGL_PLATFORM_NEXUS_BRCM                 0x32F0

Additions to the EGL Specification

    None.

New Behavior

    To determine if the EGL implementation supports this extension, clients
    should query the EGL_EXTENSIONS string of EGL_NO_DISPLAY.
    To obtain an EGLDisplay backed by a Nexus display, call
    eglGetPlatformDisplayEXT with <platform> set to EGL_PLATFORM_NEXUS_BRCM.
    The <native_display> parameter specifies the Nexus display to use and must
    either be obtained by calling NEXUS_Display_Open() or be EGL_DEFAULT_DISPLAY.

    To obtain an on-screen rendering surface from a Nexus Window, call
    eglCreatePlatformWindowSurfaceEXT with a <dpy> that belongs to Nexus and
    a <native_window> that points to an Nexus Window obtained by calling the
    NXPL_CreateNativeWindow() function.

    To obtain an offscreen rendering surface from a Nexus Pixmap, call
    eglCreatePlatformPixmapSurfaceEXT with a <dpy> that belongs to Nexus and
    a <native_pixmap> that points to an Nexus Pixmap obtained by calling the
    NXPL_CreateCompatiblePixmap() function.

Issues

    1. TBD
