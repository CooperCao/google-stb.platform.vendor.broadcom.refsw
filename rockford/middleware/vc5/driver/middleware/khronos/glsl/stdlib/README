=== README ===

This directory is processed by the build_stdlib.py script. Although
these look like normal source files, they do not pass through the same
compilation pipeline.

The following major caveats apply:

(1) Preprocessor directives are all placed at global scope

All preprocessor directives are collected and moved to the top
(logically) of every file.

(2) C-style comments aren't a good idea.

These files are collections of routines, and will be dissected. That
means our (weak) parser in the Python script has to understand
everything that isn't in a function body. At the moment, it doesn't
understand C-style /* */ comments. Use C++ style // comments.

(3) No variables outside of functions.

As for (2): the parser doesn't understand globals (and its arguable it
shouldn't) so don't use them. Things will break.
