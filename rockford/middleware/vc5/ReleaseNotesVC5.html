   <h1>VC5 Driver & Tools - Release Notes</h1>

   <h2>16.1</h2>

   <h3>New features</h3>
   <ul>
      <li>Added support for EGL 1.5</li>
      <li>Various performance improvements in a number of areas</li>
      <li>Reduced the system memory consumption used by OpenGL ES 2 &amp; 3 contexts by around 5MB each</li>
      <li>GPUMonitor : object state viewing has now mostly been integrated into a single 'State' dialog</li>
      <li>GPUMonitor : extra program interface data is available in the program object display</li>
      <li>GPUMonitor : state for vertex array objects, buffer objects, query objects, sync objects and transform feedback objects is now displayable</li>
      <li>GPUMonitor : now uses a circular buffer to record event data allowing longer run times without massive data overhead</li>
   </ul>

   <h3>Bug fixes</h3>
   <ul>
      <li>GL sampler objects are now shareable</li>
      <li>Fix for buffer creation status using non-generated names</li>
      <li>Fixed a cache flushing issue that could rarely result in a partial buffer update</li>
      <li>eglquerysurface and eglsurfaceattrib weren't supporting all attributes correctly</li>
      <li>Fixed an issue with scissored multisample-FBO framebuffer blits</li>
      <li>Removed GL_OES_depth32 from the extension list as we don't, and never have, supported it</li>
      <li>A resize after eglCreateWindowSurface(), but before any other EGL or GL calls, failed to take effect</li>
      <li>Various shader compiler fixes for large shaders</li>
   </ul>

   </ul>

   <h3>Bug fixes</h3>
   <ul>
      <li>Fixed a problem where large buffers (>2Kx2K) could fail to render due to insufficient bin memory</li>
      <li>The GLSL compiler now better schedules control flow constructs</li>
      <li>Fixed a race condition during power off which could very occasionally cause a lockup</li>
      <li>Fixed occasional issue with egl/glClientWaitSync for texture dependencies</li>
      <li>Worked around GLSL issue where ldunif sometimes returned incorrect data following a branch uniform instruction</li>
      <li>GLSL compiler now correctly allows multiple function declarations where the specification permits</li>
      <li>Fixed an issue where repeated running of ogl nxclient apps caused loss of output</li>
      <li>Fixed a problem running GPUMonitor with kernel mode application builds</li>
      <li>GPUMonitor's performance counters are more accurately sampled for long running jobs</li>
      <li>Fixed a potential race condition which could cause a stall during program termination</li>
      <li>Fixed a problem with scissored framebuffer blits</li>
      <li>Fixed a display issue in the Nexus platform layer which could occasionally cause tearing even in vsync mode</li>
