/*=***********************************
SyncChannel provides high-precision lipsync by making fine tuned adjustments
to audio and video inputs and outputs.

First, you must use StcChannel to provide basic lipsync using TSM.
Then, you can add SyncChannel to fine tune the lipsync.

The information SyncChannel uses includes, but is not limited to:
o Total delay in Display video path (which varies for HD and SD paths based on # of capture buffers)
o PTS/STC phase offset in video decoder
o Total delay in Audio path (due to offset in the PCM ring buffers)

See nexus/examples/sync_channel.c for a sample app.

/**
Summary:
Settings for NEXUS_SyncChannel

Description:
All audio and video input handles used to present a single program should be specified in NEXUS_SyncChannelSettings.
Internally, SyncChannel will determine which outputs are tied to those inputs.
Then, SyncChannel will monitor those inputs and outputs and make necessary adjustments to them in order to achieve precision lipsync.

If an input is no longer used (e.g. channel change from digital to analog, system shutdown, etc.),
the app should NULL out those handles as follows:

    NEXUS_SyncChannel_GetSettings(syncChannel, &settings);
    settings.videoInput = NULL;
    settings.audioInput[0] = NULL;
    settings.audioInput[1] = NULL;
    NEXUS_SyncChannel_SetSettings(syncChannel, &settings);

If an output belonging to a sync-managed input is removed from that input, or a new output is added to a sync-managed input,
(e.g., a window is disconnected/reconnected, audio output is switched between inputs) then SyncChannel must be told to rediscover the new
input-output path connections. You should call NEXUS_SyncChannel_SetSettings with all NULL's, then call it again with the inputs you intend
to use for the next decode session. This will force sync to rediscover the new input-output connections.  This forced rediscovery of connections
is not required for cases where an output's properties change without changing its connection to the input (e.g., display format change, audio volume
change).

SyncChannel provides two types of lipsync improvements to TSM. They are:
1) basic lipsync - sync multiple displays and multiple audio outputs together. also, sync audio and video within +/- 1 video frame.
2) precision lipsync - adds subframe audio adjustments based on video feedback
