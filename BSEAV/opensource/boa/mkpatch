# This script assumes that there is a valid and compilable boa directory
# similar to ... obj.97366/BSEAV/opensource/boa/arm-linux.debug/.
# This script will extract the unmodified boa source files to a directory
# called boa-0.94.14rc21. It will then compare the "boa-0.94.14rc21" directory
# changes to the unchanged "boa-0.94.14rc21" files and create a patch file in
# the process.
