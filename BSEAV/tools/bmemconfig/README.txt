What is bmemconfig?

bmemconfig is a tool which provides refsw memory estimates by pulling the memory estimate by actually running the code.
It is build on the top of nexus platform memconfig facility. bmemconfig provides a graphical UI that can be pulled from any
browser on the same network.

    1. Memory numbers are generated the code that will run on real world application. Memory documentation is generated by the real code
    2. Uses standard web technologies like HTML, Javascript and cgi. Easy to understand and maintain.
    3. Developers do not need to maintain memory documentation in the form of spreadsheets as memory usage documentation is generated directly from the source code.
    4. For additional documentation refer to Help section of the bmemconfig tool.
