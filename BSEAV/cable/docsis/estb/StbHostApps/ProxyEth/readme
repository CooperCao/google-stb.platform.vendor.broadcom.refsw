Overview:
--------------
Broadcom have some cost down STB + Docsis 2.0 reference design like BCM97584SFF which don't have CPE ethernet interface
on CM side, but Docsis 2.0 ATP test have some cases which require to perform SNMP operatons on this interface.
To support this kind of board to pass Docsis 2.0 ATP, we can bridge STB ethernet interface with CM MII, and treat STB
ethernet as the CPE interface. proxy_eth is the STB side app to implement this idea.

Setup Guide:
--------------
1. Check with your PM/FAE to get correct CM source code which support D20 ATP for boards without CM CPE ethernet interface.
2. Below is the set up instructions for configuration that MII is the only connection between CM and STB
    1) CM build options:

    ./makeapp bcm93349dcmvendor reverse_rmagnum miibypassephy noslim proxy_eth

    2) Configure Reverse RMagnum to be run over MII

    CM>cd /non/hal
    ip_transport_hal eth
    write

    3) On STB linux console, make below configuration.(Take BCM97584SFF as example)

	brctl addbr br0
	brctl addif br0 eth1
	brctl addif br0 eth0
	ifup br0
	sleep 5
	ifconfig br0:1 192.168.17.10
	sleep 1
	cd /your_binary_folder
	.proxy_eth &
	./nexus tune_qam

	a)  Here, eth0 is STB ethernet interface, eth1 is MII. You might need to change it as per your board.
	b) tune_qam here is an nexus example to have 7584 frontend working, since CM rely on 7584 frontend on BCM97584SFF design.

3. Below is the set up instructions for configuration that both USB and MII are connected between CM and STB, and run RPC over USB.
    1) CM build options:

    ./makeapp bcm93349dcmvendor reverse_rmagnum miibypassephy noslim proxy_eth usb_rpc

    2) Configure Reverse RMagnum to be run over USB

    CM>cd /non/hal
    ip_transport_hal usb
    write

4. On STB linux console, make below configuration.(Take BCM97584SFF as example)

	brctl addbr br0
	brctl addif br0 eth1
	brctl addif br0 eth0
	ifup br0
	sleep 5
	ifconfig eth2:1 192.168.17.10
	sleep 1
	cd /your_binary_folder
	.proxy_eth &
	./nexus tune_qam

	a) Here, eth0 is STB ethernet interface, eth1 is MII, eth2 is USB. You might need to change it as per your board.
	b) tune_qam here is an nexus example to have 7584 frontend working, since CM rely on 7584 frontend on BCM97584SFF design.
