This directory holds zip (.zip), egg (*.egg) and wheel (*.whl) files. The
latter two are just zip format files with metadata added, very similar
to Java .jar files. Zipfiles are a good way to store third-party code
because they will be invisible to pep8 and pylint so the fact that some
third-party code may not meet our coding standards can be hidden.

It also helps a good bit with compatibility/cross-platform libraries. For
instance the Python 2.6 compatible standalone version of argparse.py is
here as a .whl. Since these zip packages are placed last on sys.path,
the official version will be found first by Python 2.7 whereas with 2.6
the search will reach the compatibility .whl.

There's also a provision for platform-specific packages containing
compiled native code. The sys.path is set up to prefer platform-specific
packages over general versions of the same, on the assumption that the
platform-specific version exists to provide compiled native speedups.

Note that subdirectories at this level must be lower case due to rsync
exclusion rules in use for remote sites.
