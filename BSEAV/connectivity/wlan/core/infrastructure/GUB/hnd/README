Each module here correlates directly with an hnd command. Thus
./hnd/cleanup.py implements the command "hnd cleanup" (or "gub cleanup").
A couple of notes:

1. Subdirectories can be used to introduce an entire category of command.
   Thus ./hnd/scm/checkout.py maps to "hnd scm checkout".
2. Aliases are supported: "hnd scm co" is an alias to
   "hnd scm checkout" and both are implemented in ./hnd/scm/checkout.py.
3. A few old, original "hnd" commands are implemented in lib/old.py rather
   than having their own module here. This is merely historical and should
   not be extended.

New modules in this directory may be started from the hnd/STUB.py example.
