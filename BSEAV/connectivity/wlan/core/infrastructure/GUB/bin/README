The convention here in the ./bin directory is that publicly available
tools (thus gub, hnd, nfscp, etc) do NOT have a .py extension. Internal-use
scripts such as teetime.py are distinguished by having the .py.

If the driver program is accessed via a symlink it behaves as if it was
invoked directly with a subcommand by that name. E.g. given the symlink
"cstyle -> gub", "cstyle foo.c" becomes shorthand for "hnd cstyle foo.c".

New commands in this directory may be started from the bin/STUB example.

We currently suppress the creation of .pyc files.  Not for any known
good reason, I was just concerned about potential permissions issues
with .pyc files, but maybe I should have just trusted Python to do
the right thing.  Suppression is implemented by turning them off in
preface.py which is the first module imported by any hnd command.
This comes to late to prevent creation of preface.pyc itself though. We
could suppress that by keeping a directory with the same name but have
not yet gone to that extreme.
