# Testrig access control rules used by SigBatch
# Format: testrig, rule1, rule2, ... ruleN,

# Notes:
# 1) If there are no rules at all for a testrig, then only the testrig owner 
#    can use the testrig, nobody else!
# 2) Each rule is a time range and one or more userids allowed to use the 
#    testrig during that time range
# 3) All rules for a testrig must be on one line
# 4) If there are overlapping / conflicting rules, the more restrictive
#    rules are used
# 5) Portions of the day not covered by rules are open access for anyone
# 6) Time range "*" means all day
# 7) Time range "18-10" means 6PM thru midnight until 10AM
# 8) Time range "10-18" means 10AM until 6PM
# 9) Some testrigs are public, with free for all access. To specify this,
#    just put: norules
