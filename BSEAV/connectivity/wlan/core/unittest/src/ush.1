.Sh NAME
.Nm ush
.Nd remote shell with status codes
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ush
.Op Fl p Ar port
.Ar host
.Ar command
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Ush
executes
.Ar command
on
.Ar host  .
.Pp
.Nm Ush
copies its standard input to the remote command, the standard output
of the remote command to its standard output, and the standard error
of the remote command to its standard error.  Interrupt, quit,
terminate and other standard signals are propagated to the remote
command;
.Nm ush
normally terminates when the remote command does, with the same exit
status as the remote command.

The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl p
By default,
.Nm Ush
and
.Nm Ushd
communicate on port 4700.
The
.Fl p
option allows an alternate port to be specified.
.El
.Pp
A
.Ar command
must be specified.
.Pp
Shell metacharacters which are not quoted are interpreted on local machine,
while quoted metacharacters are interpreted on the remote machine.
For example, the command
.Pp
.Dl ush otherhost cat remotefile >> localfile
.Pp
appends the remote file
.Ar remotefile
to the local file
.Ar localfile ,
while
.Pp
.Dl ush otherhost cat remotefile \&">>\&" other_remotefile
.Pp
appends
.Ar remotefile
to
.Ar other_remotefile .

.Xr ushd 8
.Xr rsh 1
.Xr ssh 1
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm Ush
command was inspired by
.Xr rsh
from
.Bx 4.2 and
.Xr fsh
by Per Cederqvist.
.Sh BUGS
You cannot run an interactive command
(like
.Xr rogue  6
or
.Xr vi  1  )
using
.Nm ush  ;
use
.Xr rlogin  1
or
.Xr ssh 1
instead.
