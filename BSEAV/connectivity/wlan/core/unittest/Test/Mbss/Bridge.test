# Usage: Bridge AP1 STA1 AP2 STA2 LAN WAN
#
# AP1 and AP2 are real or virtual interfaces on the same router.
# STA1 and STA2 are not associated.
# LAN is a reference host on the Lan
# WAN is a reference host on the Wan

# During the test STA1 will be associated with AP1 and STA2 will be
# associated with AP2 then further tests will be applied to the
# resulting interfaces and connections.
