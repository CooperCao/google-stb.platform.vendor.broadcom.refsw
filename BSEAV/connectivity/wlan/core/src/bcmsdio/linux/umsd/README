	     User Mode SDIO Kernel Driver Module for Linux

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This driver allows access to SDIO standard host cards running in the
kernel from user space.

To build the module on a 2.6 machine, cd to linux-2.6 and type gmake.
NOTE: currently Linux 2.4 has not been compiled or tested in any way.

The umsd device major number is 232.  The minor number determines the
controller number and the slot number.  These are currently define as:

	umsd0 - umsd3: Controller 0, Slot 1 - Slot 4
	umsd4 - umsd7: Controller 1, Slot 1 - Slot 4

It's necessary to create the umsd device(s):

	mknod /dev/umsd0 c 232 0
	chmod a+rw /dev/umsd0
	mknod /dev/umsd1 c 232 1
	chmod a+rw /dev/umsd1

Note: in Fedora distributions your device may disappear each time the
machine is reset.  To have the device created automatically at boot
time, also create it in the udev directory:

	mknod /etc/udev/devices/umsd0 c 232 0
	chmod a+rw /etc/udev/devices/umsd0
	mknod /etc/udev/devices/umsd1 c 232 1
	chmod a+rw /etc/udev/devices/umsd1

Then insert the module.  Note that this module should not be inserted at
the same time any other PCI SPI host module (such as dhd-cdc-sdstd) is
inserted, as only one will be able to claim the PCI device.

	insmod umsd.ko            (Linux 2.6)

All operations are synchronous and supported via the ioctl system call.

The external device interrupt line is supported.  The SDEVSIG ioctl
enables the interrupt and configures a Unix signal number to send to the
controlling process when the interrupt line is asserted.  The device
interrupt remains masked until the next SDEVSIG ioctl.
