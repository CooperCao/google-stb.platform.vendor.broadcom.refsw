Broadcom SDIO Host Controller Driver

Description as of 05/18/2007

  - Host Controller Drivers for the Broadcom SDIOH Host Controller and
    Standard (Arasan) Host Controller.

  - Subdir structure similar to wl, et, dhd, and so forth:
    sys   -- contains source files
    linux -- build directory for linux OS standalone driver (not
             implemented yet.)

  - bcmsdbrcm* files are for the Broadcom SDIOH 
  - bcmsdstd* files are for the Standard SDIO Host Controller
  - bcmsdspi.c is for SD-SPI (SDIO over SPI) protocol conversion
  - bcmpcispi* files are for H2SPI (H. Harte's PCI FPGA SPI Host Controller)
  - bcmcheetahspi* files are for the Cheetah USB SPI Host Controller
  - bcmu2cspi* files are for the Diolan USB SPI Host Controller

Note about USB SPI controllers:
    The USB drivers for Cheetah and Diolan are known not to work
    because they try to block in bad places, and it may not be
    feasible to fix them.
