    </li>
</ul>

<H2>Installing the Software</H2>

<P>
If you are installing over a previous development release, please uninstall
the earlier release by hand. To uninstall, move all "USB iLine" extensions
in the Extensions folder to the Trash. Unplug the USB device and reboot.
</P>

<P>
To install the USB iLine10 software, the USB device should be
unplugged. Drag the "USB iLine10&trade; Broadcom" extension to the System Folder
icon on the boot drive. A dialog will inform you that the file will
be stored in the Extensions folder. Alternatively, the file can be
copied directly to the Extensions folder. Plug in the USB
device. There is no need to reboot after installing the file.
</P>

<H2>Internet Install</H2>

<P>
There is a great feature for USB device driver installs on Mac OS you
may wish to support. When you plug in a device for which there is no
driver installed, a dialog is presented to the user reading:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>
    Drivers needed for the USB device "<VAR>USB device string</VAR>"
    are not available. Would you like to look for these
    drivers over the Internet?
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
(The "<VAR>USB device string</VAR>" is the string read out of the USB firmware
descriptor on the device.)
</P>

<P>
This feature was introduced in Mac OS 9, so it is not available on Mac
OS 8.6.
</P>

<P>
The requirements for making the Internet download available are fairly
small. The process is described in the 
<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn/tn1191.html">USB Software Update
Technote</A>, technote 1191, from Apple.
</P>

<P>
The summary is that someone at your company needs to 
<A HREF="http://connect.apple.com/">register as an Apple Developer</A>
(free) at the <A HREF="http://www.apple.com/developer/">Apple Developer</A>
web site. Apple DTS (Developer Technical Support) needs
to be sent an email letting them know to associate the developer with
your USB VID/PID. After that, the developer has access to the
<A HREF="http://war.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/USBEditorStaging">
Apple USB Editor Web Page</A>, where they can enter the record
describing the device and enter the URL pointing to the driver. The
record matching the device for the Software Locator is kept at Apple,
but the driver itself is kept by the company owning the
device. Therefore the URL points at the company's web site;
<CODE>&lt;http://broadcom.com/support/drivers/usb/VIDXXXX_PIDXXXX.hqx&gt;</CODE> would be
an example. (Just an example, it doesn't exist.)
</P>

<P>
To test out the driver download process before activating it on the
production server, the record should be entered into the development
Software Update server. Set up a test Mac to use the development
sever by using the Software Locator Switch. The Software Locator
Switch tool is available in the USB DDK. The USB DDK can be downloaded
from the <A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/sdk/index.html">Apple SDK/DDK</A> web page.
</P>

<H2>Using the USB iLine10 Device</H2>

When a USB iLine10 device is pugged in, a new choice, "USB iLine", will be
available in the "Connect via:" pop-up menu in the AppleTalk and TCP/IP control
panels. Selecting this connection will route network traffic over the USB iLine10
device.

<H2>Known Issues</h2>

<ul>

<li>The driver requires the Macintosh USB Manager version 1.3 or later. Version 1.3 is
part of Mac OS 9 and is also built into the ROM file of certain Macs that shipped
with Mac OS 8.6. The document
<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/hardware/usb/versionusb.htm">USB Versions and Functionality</A>
on the Apple web site describes the Macintosh models and Mac OS
versions that shipped with USB Manager 1.3.
</li>

<li>
The Mac will hang if AppleShareIP (not personal file share) is running as a file server
using the USB device, AppleTalk is inactive, and the device is hot unplugged.
</li>

<li>
The network connection will not be usable if IPNetRouter is configured to use the USB device
and is running, the device is hot unplugged, then hot replugged. The connection is usable if
IPNetRouter is shutdown before the device is hot replugged.
</li>

</ul>
