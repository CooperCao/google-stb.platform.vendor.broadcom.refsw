<H2>&nbsp;Known Limitations, Problems, and Notices</H2>
<UL>
  <UL>
	<li> There is no support for Win9x at this time.
	<li> When displaying networks, wlconfig displays networks from top to bottom.  If you decide to pipe these
	     results to a file to create a batch file for updating networks on other machines, the ordering of
	  	the preferred networks will be in reverse order.  The last network in your batch file will
		be the first network in the preferred network ordering.
	<li> Users should be aware that if wlconfig is used with an incorrect syntax, you will get a Windows dialog box.  
		Check your syntax if you see a message similar to "wlconfig.exe has encountered a 
problem and needs to close. We are sorry for the inconvenience". 
	<li> It is easy to create invalid preferred networks with this tool.  The validation and constraints used in our control panel applet are not available in this tool.  For instance, the tray will not allow certain types of EAP stacks to exist, but you can create them with this tool.  If the combination is not allowed in our tray, do not expect it to work with wlconfig.
	<li> Selecting a certificate from the command line is not very precise. For example, the '-tls' option will search the current user's certificate store for a certificate that contains the specified subject name string. If there are multiple certificates that match the string supplied to '-tls', there is no way to specify which one of those multiple matches you want to use.
	<li> The '-validate' option has a similar ambiguity, but it deals with the 'Issuer' field in certificates from the ROOT store.
</UL></UL>


<H2>&nbsp;What's New in the 1.2 Release?</H2>
<UL>
  <UL>
	<li> Upgraded tool and documentation for new EAP Types.  This includes WPA2, WPA2-PSK, WPA-Auto, WPA-PSK-Auto, and EAP-FAST
</ul></ul>




<H2>&nbsp;Usage Models</H2>
<UL>
  <UL>
	<li> The option list for this tool is rather long and complicated.  For this reason, it is not recommend that you try to configure a network by
starting with 'wlconfig'.  Instead, you should configure a network through the Broadcom Wireless Configuration Utility (the control panel
applet) and then use 'wlconfig' to print out the current network in a form that is suitable as input for 'wlconfig'.<br>
For example, imagine you just configured a LEAP network using the control panel applet.  To print out the equivalent 'wlconfig' command for that network, just issue the 'wlconfig' command with no arguments.<br>
<br>
<ul>
    wlconfig<br.
    Wireless Network Connection 6:<br>
    -ssid "SomeAP" -8021x -wep -leap -user "John_Q_User" -password "********"<br><br>
</UL>

	<li> To turn that into a valid command line for 'wlconfig' you must specify which adapter the network should be added to ('-A' option), and you must fill in the password again.  'wlconfig' does not have access to cleartext passwords or wep keys, so those are always replaced by "********" when printing networks.<br><br>
	<ul>
         wlconfig -A "Wire*" -ssid "SomeAP" -8021x -wep -leap -user "John_Q_User" -password "SuperSecret"<br><br>
	</ul>
	If you wanted to add this network to the end of the exiting list of preferred networks, just specify the '-a' option with a sufficiently
	high index.<br>
	<br>
        wlconfig -A "Wire*" -a 100 -ssid "SomeAP" -8021x -wep -leap -user "John_Q_User" -password "SuperSecret"<br>
	<li>Examples:
	<ul>
           wlconfig -?&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp... Show a summary of all options<br>
