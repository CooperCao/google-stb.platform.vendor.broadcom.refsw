<h2>&nbsp;What's New in This Release</h2>

<ul>
<h3>New in Release 3.01</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Initial driver support for BCM4402\BCM4401.
    <li>WHQL clean on WinXP systems.

  </ul>

</ul>
<h2>&nbsp;What's Included in This Release</h2>

<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>NDIS 5.0 miniport driver</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h2>&nbsp;Known Limitations or Problems</h2>

<ul>
  <h3>Software:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>  All WHQL tests are to be run on a
	  dual processor system with a FoxFire card installed.  With the card installed we came up with
	  errors that were not explainable.  Those errors never occurred when the FoxFire card was not
	  installed.  As per WHQL guidelines on the 
	  <u><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hwtest/search/details.asp?Type=Errata&ID=576&Key=All%20WHQL&Sort=Date">MSFT WHQL Website</u></a>
	  run the tests without the card installed, they will accept FoxFire card based errors, then run
	  a select few tests on a uni-processor system with the FoxFire card installed.  Since this new 
	  guidance from MSFT is only 4 days old from the writing of these notes, there is a hiccup.  You 
	  must run a single NDISTEST to prime the pump before executing the Driver Verifier test such that it has the appropriate configuration
	  information setup by NDISTEST.
    <li>  We do not indicate to NDIS that we support Magic Packet WOL.  In prior OS's this was sufficient
	  to cause WHQL to block the test.  In WinXP the test does not get blocked, gets run, and produces
	  a failure.  This is currently under advisement with MSFT.
  </ul>
</ul>
