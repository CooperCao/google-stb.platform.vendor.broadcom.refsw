<h2>&nbsp;Known Limitations or Problems</h2>

<ul>

<h3>Software:</h3>

<ul>

<li>Flash devices noted above in <B>bold</B> have been tested with physical devices.

Due to limitations in obtaining flash parts the other parts should work but were

unavailabe at the time of writing this release note (3/08/01). The devices not

in bold should work as the only the device rev id is different. The 2.33.0.2 release

supports those rev identifiers. </li>

<li>To complete a software iLine upgrade of release 2.33.0.2 over a previous RC release 

you must make a change in dl.bat.  Use "SET VER=0x02210002".</li>

<li>When running a packet test of 10,000 packets, 3 extra were sent and were observed

to be duplicates. </li>

<li>If a user runs Netmeeting over the bridge with Win2K AND has 802.1p Prioirty Support enabled that is
found in the Device Manager/Network Adapter/Properties/Advanced, the network connection 
will be lost and NetMeeting will not be able to communicate.  To disable, select 'Disable'
in that field.  Win2K ships with this feature disabled as default. </li>
