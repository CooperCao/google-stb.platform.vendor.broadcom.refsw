<h2>MAC Programming</h2>

<OL>
<LI>The first time you plug in a dongle into a PC, it should bring up the
"Add New Hardware Wizard" for "Unprogrammed Broadcom USB iLine10(tm) Network
Adapter". Click on the "Next" button. 

<P> <LI>It will then offer to "Search for the best driver for your device."
Click on "Next" again. 

<P> <LI>In the next panel you should select the option to "Specify a location." 
Point it to "C:\bcm42xu\qta" or the location of the qta directory created by 
this distribution and click on "Next." 

<P> <LI>It will then say the it found a driver and that its
location is "C:\bcm42xu\qta\qtprog.inf," click on "Next" one more
time. 

<P> <LI>At that point, it will say "Windows has finished installing the
software that your new hardware device requires." Click on "Finish"
and you are done. After you have gone through this process an a
machine, the qtprog driver installed by it is now in place and it
claims ownership of the unprogrammed devices, so you will not see
the "Add New Hardware Wizard" again.

<P> <LI>Start the program macparse.exe. This is a Windows GUI application that
allows one to program the i2c from scratch as well as change the MAC address,
DeviceId, VendorId, and the strings descriptions of a previously programmed
device.

<P> If you are programming a board for the first time:

<UL>
<LI>Click on File->Read BIN File and type i2cimg.bin or browse to find it. 

<LI>Fill in the new MAC address, vid, pid, and strings. 

<LI>Finally, click on "Write EEPROM" (not Update) and wait for the "Done"
message.

<LI>That's it. You can now unplug that board and program
another one by simply plugging it in, updating the MAC address
and clicking on "Write EEPROM." The MAC address can be made
to increment automatically by checking the "Auto Increment" box,
but BEWARE that the program has a bug - it increments
the numbers as if they were decimal when in fact they are hex,
so 19 becomes 20, not 1A, even though 1A will become 1B.

<LI>You can program as many boards as you want following this
procedure. In fact it is recommended that you dedicate
a machine to i2c programming. That machine should not have the
NDIS driver installed into it so that eveb boards that have
already been programmed with the vid/pid claimed by the NDIS
driver can be re-programmed. To be able to do this, it is
necessary to edit the file qta\qtprog.inf and adding the proper
vid/pid pair under the QTProgInstall section *before* installing
the qtprog driver. 
</UL>

<P> If you are updating the MAC address or vid/pid of a previously
programmed board:

<UL>
<LI> Fill in the values you want for all of these fields
and click on "Update". It will read the current values from the small
i2c and then it will write the new ones back. When it is done it
displays the message "Done."
</UL>

<P><LI>Disconnect/reconnect to reset it. Reconnecting should bring up the "Add New
Hardware Wizard" for "Broadcom USB iLine10(tm) Network Adapter" after a couple of
seconds. Follow the Wizard screens through, searching for the best driver, and
specifying a location to search as the c:\bcm42xu directory. This is the
directory containing the installer file, bcm42u.inf.

<P><LI>Adjust the network settings for the "TCP/IP = Broadcom USB iLine10(tm) Network
Adapter" as appropriate for your network.

</OL>
