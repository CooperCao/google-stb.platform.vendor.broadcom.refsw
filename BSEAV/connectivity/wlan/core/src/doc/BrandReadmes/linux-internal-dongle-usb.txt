This distribution includes binary files in the following subdirectories:

firmware/4315usb  -- binary firmware images for download to the dongle device
firmware/         -- nvram download files for boards with incomplete OTP
host/             -- linux kernel modules: host drivers for the dongle
apps/             -- tools for dongle download and runtime WLAN commands

A brief overview of how to use these files can be found in ReleaseNotes.html.

Source code for rebuilding the host-side binaries is provided in the src
directory; an overview of that structure is:

src/include	-- various header files
src/shared	-- source files which may be shared by several binaries
src/dongle	-- dongle-specific header
src/dhd/linux	-- build directory for dhd linux module (dhd)
src/dhd/sys	-- source code for dhd driver

To rebuild the dhd kernel module:
  % cd src/dhd/linux
  % make dhd-cdc-usb

The resulting module file (dhd.o or dhd.ko) will be placed in a subdirectory
named dhd-cdc-usb-<version>, where <version> is the Linux kernel version of
the compiling system.

To rebuild a module with additional debugging messages enabled, add -debug to
the make target:
  % cd src/dhd/linux
  % make dhd-cdc-usb-debug
