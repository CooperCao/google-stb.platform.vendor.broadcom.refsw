		USB Host Remote Download
		
	
This code uses the linux libusb library that supports user mode access
of usb functionality, hence libusb must be installed before building
this code.

To have the code auto start on the usb connection you will have to 
have USB hotplug installed on your linux machine. The file usb.usermap
shows the entry required to kick off the usbRdl script. The usb.usermap
file can be found under /etc/hotplug. Create a directory /etc/hotplug/usb
and put the usbRdl script there. Obviously you will need to modify 
this script to run bcmdl from the correct location.
