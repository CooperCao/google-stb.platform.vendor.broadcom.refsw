Remote Socket Test
------------------

This directory contains a kernel module for Linux 2.4 or Linux 2.6 that
can be used for testing Remote Sockets (RSock) inside the Linux kernel.
The module contains "ifconfig" and "ttcp" applications, suitably
modified for compilation within the kernel, and uses the native kernel
USB facilities to implement the bus interface over which RSock protocol
messages are sent.  The purpose was originally to measure RSock ttcp
performance.

A device device is created (/dev/rst0 or /dev/usb/rstest).  "ifconfig"
and "ttcp" commands may be echoed into this device to control the kernel
module.

See also src/toe/rsock/user/usb for a simpler user-level implementation
that uses libusb to talk to the USB device but is (in theory) much
slower.

Linux 2.4 requires:

mknod -m 660 /dev/usb/rstest c 180 144

Some useful scripts are in the "scripts" subdirectory.

NOTE: this hasn't been built in a while and the Makefiles are in a state
of flux where I was trying to support both versions in a single
Makefile.  Good luck!

Building on Linux 2.4: make -f Makefile.24
Building on Linux 2.6: make
