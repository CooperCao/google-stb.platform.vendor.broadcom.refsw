This diectory contains files to build hndrte dongle simulator running on armulator.

The simualtor uses I/O models in the cheeseball to simulate the device. The cheeseball can be built into the simulator in which case it is called internal cheeseball. Or the cheeseball can be left out and be built as a shared library loaded and used by the armulator in which case it is called an external cheeseball.

Makefile is used to build the simulator image 'rtesim' that is.

Makefile.dngl is used to build the external cheeseball with connectivity to venets through sockets. It is used for tcp offload or rsock.

The external cheeseballs are built with usb as the host bus. To build the external cheeseballs with sdio as the host bus define DNGLBUS=sdio, for example, make -f Makefile.dngl DNGLBUS=sdio

To build the external cheeseballs with NPHY as d11 phy define BCMSIM_D11PHY=N, for example, make -f Makefile.dngl BCMSIM_D11PHY=N

To build the external cheeseballs  with instruction dummping capability define INSTR_DUMP=1, for example, make -f Makefile.dngl INSTR_DUMP=1
