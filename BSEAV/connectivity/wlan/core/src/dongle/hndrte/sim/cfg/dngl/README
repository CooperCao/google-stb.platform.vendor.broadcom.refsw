This directory contains four text files used to configure the Armulator
in order to allow it to use the cheeseball (WLAN chip simulator)
peripheral model.

The model also includes support for socket-simulated bus (USB/SDIO)
interface and socket-simulated wireless interface.

These files are normally found in $ARMHOME/linux/bin:
	peripheral.ami
	peripheral.dsc
	default.ami
	ARMulator.cnf

The first three are needed to run armsd using the dngl.so plug-in
peripheral model, and the fourth is needed to run rdi-stub for remote
debugging.

Add the directory containing these files to the front of your ARMCONF
path:

(tcsh)
	setenv ARMCONF $SRCBASE/src/dongle/rte/sim/cfg/dngl:$ARMCONF

(bash)
	ARMCONF=$SRCBASE/src/dongle/rte/sim/cfg/dngl:$ARMCONF
	export ARMCONF
