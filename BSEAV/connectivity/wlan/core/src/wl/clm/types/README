This directory is for CLM flag files which will get passed to
ClmCompiler using its --config_file option. If the make variable
CLM_TYPE is set to 'xyz', then the file xyz.clm from this directory
will be passed to the CLM compiler. See the twiki page
http://hwnbu-twiki.broadcom.com/bin/view/Mwgroup/ClmRestructure#4_Build_Model
for full details.

The CLM compiler itself is documented separately. In particular its current set
of flags can be seen via "ClmCompiler --help".
