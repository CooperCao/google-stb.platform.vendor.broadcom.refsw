Broadcom 802.11 wireless device driver configuration file directory.
Refer to http://hwnbu-twiki.broadcom.com/bin/view/Mwgroup/WlDriverConfig

The wl driver supports a large set of configurable features.
The wlconfig_* files in this directory, along with wl.mk,
control which compile-time flags and which source files are used to compile wl.o .

This directory centralizes wl driver configuration policy and mechanism
allowing us to change the particular compile-time flags and source files
easily without having to grep and edit dozens of target Makefiles distributed
all over the source tree.

Each target Makefile does:

	include wlconfig_<application>
	include wl.mk

- wlconfig_<application> files list the options for a particular application
- wl.mk translates these options into the list of specific flags and source files

Please refactor the wlconfig_* files mercelessly !
