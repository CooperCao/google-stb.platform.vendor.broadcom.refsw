/*=*********************************************
Bwin is a basic windowing system for embedded systems.

It supports the following:

o Multiple instances of the windowing system (no global variables)
o Multiple framebuffers with different pixel formats.
o Antialiased true-type fonts through Freetype2.
o PNG and JPEG rendering.
o Hardware acceleration through user-overrideable drawing primitives.
o Multiple pixel formats supported at the same time (it doesn't require you to pick
  one pixel format at compile time).
o Complete windowing support, including parent/child relationships, zorder among siblings,
  clipping to a window and to the framebuffer, consolidation of repaint events, etc.
o Opaque or transparent windows. A transparent window requires that a parent be redrawn
  even if a child completely covers an updated area. An opaque window can just draw
  the child.
o UTF8 encoded text (TODO)

It does not support the following:

o Keyboard, mouse or any predefined input device. Instead, you can plug in
  any number of i/o devices and process them outside of the windowing system.
o Tabbing
o Window managers (standard window decorations, etc.)
o GIF rendering
o Client/server functionality.

See iolaus/docs/requirements.txt for a complete requirements document.
