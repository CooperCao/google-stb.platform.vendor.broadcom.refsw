# This script assumes that there is a valid and compilable LiveMedia directory
# similar to ... obj.97366/BSEAV/lib/livemedia/arm-linux.debug/live.
# This script will extract the unmodified LiveMedia source files to a directory
# called live.2013.12.05. It will then compare the "live" directory changes to the
# unchanged "live.2013.12.05" files and create a patch file in the process.
