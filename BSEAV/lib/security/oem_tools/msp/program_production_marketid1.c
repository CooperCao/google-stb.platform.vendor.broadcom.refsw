/* This test app allows users to program MarketId1[31:16] to the BRCM-required
   value for non-ZD, non-ZS parts.

   This app will build and run on Zeus4 (secv1) and Zeus5 (secv2).  The test
   app will also build for Zeus1-3 but will exit early at run-time since
   MarketId1 is not defined for those platforms.  In addition, BFW4 (or later)
   is required when running on Zeus4.  This app does not support
   Zeus2/3/4 running with secv2.                                              */
