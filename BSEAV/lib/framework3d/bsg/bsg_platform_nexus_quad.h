/*=============================================================================
 The "quad exclusive display" is a specialised exclusive mode platform layer
 It supports a SINGLE native rendering window. Each frame submitted is considered
 to be one N x M of the display, so the final on-screen display is made from N x M
 frames arranged as:

 ...
 N+1 N+2 ...
 0 1 .. N

 There are two NMx buffers for the display and three 1x buffers for the application
 When a frame is submitted, it is copied into the back-buffer for the display.
 When the backbuffer is completed, it is swapped with the front buffer on the
 next vsync (or immediately in swap 0).
