[Overview]
OEMs must generate a model certificate and keys using Microsoft's Porting Kit tools.
The Porting Kit requires a template which describes platform characteristics and
specific features enabled in the Playready SDK implementation.

[Templates]
For products running with SAGE_SUPPORT=y, please use:
- BSEAV/lib/playready/2.5/template/sage/Device_certificate_template_SecureClock_example_2_5_Golden.dat

For products running with SAGE_SUPPORT=n, please use:
- BSEAV/lib/playready/2.5/template/nonsage/Device_certificate_template_AntiRoll_example_2_5_Golden.dat

[Modifying The Template]
OEMs should use the device certificate templates listed above and modify
product-specific tags such as <PRODUCT>, <MANUFACTURER>, <MAKE>, <DISTRIBUTOR>,
<MODEL>.

OEMs must *not* modify tags contained between <FEATURES> and </FEATURES>.
